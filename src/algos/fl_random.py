    # Assuming the lines too long are comments or code, they need to be split into shorter lines.

    # Split into two or more lines:
    # some_long_statement_with_code_or_comment_
    # that_is_really_long_and_needs_to_be_shortened_for_pylint

    # For the comparison with callable issue, ensure to call the function if comparing its result.
    # Example conceptual fix:
    # if some_condition == random:  # Incorrect, comparing to the callable itself
    # if some_condition == random():  # Correct, comparing to the result of calling the function

    # Remove unnecessary pass statement
    # Example:
    # if condition:
    #     pass  # This is unnecessary if there's no other statement in the block

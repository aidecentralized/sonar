## Main

Welcome to SONAR. The project is focused on the evaluation of decentralized neural network training with a focus on topology and other practical aspects.
The application currently uses GRPC to enable communication between different nodes in the network. The goal of the framework to organize everything in a modular manner. That way a researcher or engineer can easily swap out different components of the framework to test their hypothesis or a new algorithm

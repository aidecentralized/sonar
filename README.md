# Project SONAR - Self-Organizing Network of Aggregated Representations

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/aidecentralized/sonar/blob/main/docs/arch.png)

Documentation: https://aidecentralized.github.io/sonar/

A collaborative learning project where users self-organize to improve their ML models by sharing representations of their data or model.

⚠️**Warning:** This project is currently under a major revamp and may contain bugs.

## Main
The application currently uses MPI and GRPC (experimental) to enable communication between different nodes in the network. The goal of the framework to organize everything in a modular manner. That way a researcher or engineer can easily swap out different components of the framework to test their hypothesis or a new algorithm

### Framework Rewrite Objective
- [ ] O1: Benchmark existing configurations and algorithms.
- [ ] O2: Separate the communication layer (topology) from collaborative learning algorithms.
- [ ] O3: Implement a few more collaborative learning algorithms.
- [ ] O4: Improve telemetry and logging for visualization of the network. See https://github.com/aidecentralized/sonar/issues/11
- [ ] O5: Fault tolerance and rogue clients simulation.
- [ ] O6: Eliminate the need to add a BaseServer module, keep it backward compatible by instantiating the server as yet another node.
- [ ] O7: Build testing suite. See https://github.com/aidecentralized/sonar/issues/21
- [ ] O8: Set up milestones for transition to full API like interface and then launch on `pip`
